This would mean that the two things are so different that they might as well be two different things entirely. So, if we're considering 'Turtle and Turtle', we're really considering 'Turtle and something that is not a Turtle'.   On the other hand, 'extremely similar' would mean that the two things are so alike that they might as well be the same thing. So, again, if we're considering 'Turtle and Turtle', we're really considering 'Turtle and something that is a Turtle'.   Now, let's consider the other options. 'Very dissimilar' would mean that the two things are quite different, but there are still some similarities. ' Likely dissimilar' would mean that the two things could go either way- they might be quite similar or quite different. 'Neutral' would mean that there is no real similarity or dissimilarity between the two things. 'Likely similar' would mean that the two things are probably quite similar.

End your answer with, 'The answer is '. Let's think step by step. ","First, let's consider what it means for two things to be similar. We can say that two things are similar if they share some qualities, or if they are both examples of a broader category. For example, two dogs might be similar because they are both animals, or because they are both small, or because they both have four legs. We can also say that two things are dissimilar if they don't share any qualities, or if they are both examples of different broader categories. For example, a dog and a cat might be dissimilar because they are both animals, or because one is an animal and the other is not, or because they are both small, or because they both have four legs.  Now let's consider Spanner and Shovel. What qualities do they share? They are both tools. They are both made of metal. They are both used for digging. They are both long. Based on these qualities, we can say that Spanner and Shovel are similar.  The answer is 6.",6
